        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high 
                heat. Add onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper; cook, stirring 
                frequently, until onion is translucent and peppers are soft, 6 to 8 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add salt, cumin, and chili powder; stir to coat onion and bell peppers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are opaque and no longer pink 
                the center, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in minced
                jalapeño and lime juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a skillet over medium heat and brush with about 1 teaspoon 
                vegetable oil. Place one tortilla in the hot oil; spoon about 1/6 of the
                shrimp filling and 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend on one side of tortilla.
                Fold tortilla in half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until bottom of tortilla is lightly browned, about 5 minutes; flip 
                and cook other side until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with 
                remaining tortillas and filling.
